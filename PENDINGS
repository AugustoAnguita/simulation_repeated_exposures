- From charline:

	1. I would be really grateful if you could take a look on the codes for simulating the datasets, as well as the datasets that I have incorporated into the project. I remember that there were some changes in the ICC, with several versions, and I am not 100% sure the ones I have included (both codes and datasets) are the definitive ones. I need from her the SCRIPTS (not the functions) for the generation of the datasets.
	
	2. Could you please provide me (or directly incorporate the codes for the two-step approaches? I think you run these models).
	
	3. Should we provide also the codes for the results interpretation?
	
	
- From myself:

Create Rproject.

Identify all final results files, allocate them into their respective directories and be 100 % that these are the last ones. I can load them into R.

Check name of files and paths.

Complete readme.md for the whole project explaining the three parts (dataset generation, data analysis and results interpretation.

Complete readme.md for the datasets explaining the structure, number of features, individuals, etc.
